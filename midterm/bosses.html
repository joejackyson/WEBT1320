        <h1>Valheim Bosses</h1>
        <p>In each biome, except for the ocean, you can find a new boss to challenge. Each biome's boss drops an item necessary to progressing in the next biome. To summon them, you must find their alter and offer them the appropriate sacrifice.</p>
        <h2>Eikthyr</h2>
        <img src="images/valheim_eikthyr.jpg" alt="Eikthyr">
        <p>Eikthyr is the first boss you face, found in the meadows biome. At his alter you will have to sacrifice three deer trophies, which are random drops from killing deer. Once summoned, Eikthyr will attack with area of effect lightning attacks as well as a melee antler charge. Once killed, he drops hard antlers. Hard antlers are used to craft the first pickaxe so you can begin mining metal in the black forest.</p>
