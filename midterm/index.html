        <h2>What do you do in Valheim?</h2>
        <p>In Valheim, you start out in a meadows biome in the middle of a sacrificial alter. Odin's raven explains to you that you must defeat Odin's enemies in this realm, with each boss residing in a different biome. Your first goal should be to make a base and begin gathering resources. Once you are strong enough, you can take on the boss of the starting biome. Beating one boss unlocks the next biome, and each biome has new resources to use to make yourself stronger. </p>
