           <img src="images/tf2img.jpg" alt="Team Fortress 2">
           <p>Playing video games is one of my favorite things to do in my freetime. Of the games I play, a select few stand out as my favorites of all team. In particular, Team Fortress 2 is probably my favorite. I started playing in 2012, when my cousin introduced me to the game. Ever since then, it has become my most played game. I even competed in competitive leagues.</p>

           <h3>Other Games</h3>
           <p>The game that stands out almost as much as TF2 is Fallout. Fallout is very unique, set in a post=apocalyptic, alternate version of reality. After playing Fallout: New Vegas in 2013, I was hooked on the series and always looking for more.</p>

            <h2>Soccer</h2>
            <img src="images/jrsoccer.jpg" alt="Soccer">
            <p>I started playing soccer in my freshman year of highschool. Before I was confident trying out for the highschool team, I played a season of indoor soccer with a lot of my friends from class. Our team did very well, and we had a lot of fun doing so. This experience in particular grew my love for soccer. After that playing indoor, I tried out for the highschool team and quickly became a second string player. As of my sophomore year, I was already on the starting team. This inspired me to try and become one of the most impactful players on the team. I went on to play soccer in a select division, and this helped me grow further. </p>
