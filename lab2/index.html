    <h2>One of my favorite games of all time</h2>
    <h3>My favorite classes to play are Scout and Sniper</h3>
    <h4>The game is an FPS with 9 classes where you have to complete an objective to win</h4>
    <p>Team Fortress 2 is one of my favorite games. I've played it since 2012, and with the new content added in updates it has remained one of my most played games. In the 9 years I've had the game I have played it for about 4,000 hours. My favorite thing about TF2 is all of the depth in each character. All 9 Classes have completely unique aspects, playstyles, and weapons.</p>
    <p>At one point, I even played the game competetively. Competetive matches of TF2 are played in 6v6 format. I competed in a free league with some friends and played 3 seasons as scout. Our team never won first place in any division, but we did move up in divisions for my last season. Even though we didn't come first, I did receive an in-game badge for playing.</p>
