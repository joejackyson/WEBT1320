            <p>Chameleons are a top tier reptile you can't deny that. Chameleons are a very likeable reptile because they're so cool. They have funky eyeballs, a crazy tongue, and they change color. Doesn't get cooler than that.</p>
            <h2>Crested Gecko</h2>
            <img src="images/crested1.jpg" alt="Crested Gecko">
            <p>Crested geckos are another one of my favorite reptiles. They have cool looking eyes and weird toes. One of the reptiles I always like to look at when I go to the pet store.</p>
