            <h3>Format</h3>
            <p>Casual games are played with teams of 12 players, with no limit to which classes you can play or items you can use. For most game types, there is a main objective that you must capture or defend to win. The way that casual games play out depends mostly on the game type.</p>
            <h3>Casual Game Types</h3>
            <p>In casual, the main game types are payload, payload race, and capture the flag. In payload, one team must push a bomb cart to the final point to win, and the other team must prevent the push. Payload race is similar, but both teams have a bomb cart they must push to the enemy base. The first team to detonate their bomb wins. Capture the flag is more straightforward. Both teams have a base with their intel inside, and the objective is to take the enemy's intel back to your base.</p>
            <h3>Where To Play</h3>
            <p>Like any other first person shooter, if you want to play TF2 there is a very simple in-game queuing system. However, there are even more options than that. There are community servers, which are privately owned. These servers will often have custom game types and other custom files. Many players prefer community servers because of this, alongside familiarity with other regulars of the server. Another option for casual players is FaceIt. FaceIt is a third-party website that hosts casual matchmaking. The main difference being that FaceIt gives out rewards for in-game challenges, and extra security to prevent cheaters.</p>
