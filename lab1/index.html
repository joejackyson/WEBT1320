        <h1>Hello World!</h1>
        <p>Coding is something I consider to be pretty fun, and I have done it for a little while now. What got me into coding in the first
            place is my passion for gaming. Before being taught how to code properly, I would use C++ to edit heads up displays in the games
            I played. I've always found coding fun because of how customizable it is and the satisfaction of getting to see your code work.
